Hi everybody,


I was working on a file with all the GrandMA3 directory's and tought maybe someone else could find it usefull too.
If the project is usefull to you please let me know.
I dont have to much time to spend on it but try when i can.
I am not affiliated with MA in any form.
And the Project is far from finished. Keep that in mind.
 
 
 
What can you do with the file structure of GrandMA3?
You can do a lot of different things trough plugins.
You can check names, the appearance, the scribble and many more properties of almost everything.
You can also change these items trough the commandline if wanted.


In the file I made I added the Properties as a note after the directory.


A small list of what Properties worlds have:

LOCK, NO, NAME, SCRIBBLE, APPEARANCE, NOTE, MOVEGRIDCURSOR, ATTRIBUTES, SELECTION

LOCK     = Is the World Locked.
NO       = The number of the World.
Name     = The name of the World.
Scribble = The scribble of the World.

etc


This is my first open project. If you have tips or already have a part of the directory or something is wrong? Please leave a message!
Good luck!
- Ruben
